# Task Manager

A task manager application where users can create tasks either for their personal/professional endeavours or collaborate with their colleagues when working on projects. It enables users to create hierarchy of tasks and subtasks, assigning users to the subtasks, displaying the number of subtasks completed and much more. Users are notified daily about the tasks they have on a particular day, incomplete tasks from the previous day and if the task is a collaborative one, new comments, update in schedules and many more. Inorder to guage their performance, users have access to bar graphs which provides them with an outlook on their activity history.
